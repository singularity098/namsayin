      "Threshold until the noise between notes disappears, but not so far that quiet notes get cut." },
    { "volume",
      "A volume pedal. Map Volume to an expression pedal with MIDI learn (right-click the knob) to fade in, swell or "

    { "swell",
      "Automatic volume swells: each note fades in, removing the pick attack, for violin-like pads. Attack sets "

      "ambient wash." },
    { "eq.graphic",
      "A 7-band graphic EQ, like the classic pedal: each slider boosts or cuts one range from 100 Hz (low end) to "

    { "chorus",
      "Chorus thickens your sound by adding slightly detuned, moving copies of it, for shimmering cleans and lush "

    { "flanger",
      "A flanger sweeps a short, comb-filtered echo for the classic jet-plane whoosh. More Feedback makes it more "
      "metallic and resonant; Manual sets where the sweep sits. Slow rates suit chords; fast ones give a "
      "warbling effect. Put it after drive for a dramatic sweep." },
    { "phaser",
      "A phaser sweeps notches through your tone for a swirling, liquid movement. More stages give a deeper, more "
      "dramatic sweep; Vibe recreates the throbbing Uni-Vibe of 60s and 70s rock. Slow rates are great on cleans "
      "and funk, faster ones on leads." },
    { "tremolo",
      "Tremolo rhythmically turns your volume up and down, from the gentle pulse of a vintage amp to a hard "
      "chop. Opto is the soft, classic amp tremolo, Harmonic pulses the lows and highs in turns for a subtle, "
      "swirling sound, and Pan moves your sound from side to side in Stereo mode. Try Sync to lock it to the song's tempo." },
    { "rotary",
      "A rotating speaker cabinet, as used with organs and guitars: a spinning horn and drum give a swirling, "
      "Doppler sound. Switch Speed between Slow (chorale) and Fast (tremolo) while you play, and the rotors speed up "
      "and slow down naturally. Map Speed to a footswitch with MIDI learn." },
    { "doubler",
      "Makes it sound like you recorded the same part twice (or three times), for a wide, thick rhythm sound "
      "without the swirl of a chorus. Use it in Stereo mode with Width up to spread the copies across the "
      "speakers. Short delays sound tight, longer ones more like separate takes." },
    { "ringmod",
      "A ring modulator multiplies your signal with a tone, for metallic, bell-like and robotic sounds that often "
      "ignore the key you're playing in. Low frequencies give a tremolo-like warble, higher ones clangy "
      "inharmonic tones. Rate and Depth sweep the frequency for sci-fi effects." },
    { "reverb",
      "Studio reverb puts your guitar in a space. Room is small and natural, Hall is big and lush, and Plate is "
      "bright and dense like a classic studio plate. Put it at the end of the chain, after delay. Keep Mix low "
      "for a natural sense of space, or raise Decay and Mix for ambient sounds." },
    { "reverb.spring",
      "The drippy, splashy spring reverb from vintage amps and surf rock. Drip and Dwell bring out the springy "
      "splash when you pick hard. Put it after the amp model, as in a real amp; more Mix and Dwell give the classic "
      "surf sound." },
    { "shimmer",
      "An ambient reverb that pitches its tail up (or down), for a glowing, choir-like halo behind your notes. "
      "Shimmer sets how much of the shifted sound feeds back into the tail. Long Decay and slow playing make "
      "huge pads; keep it at the end of the chain." },
    { "freeze",
      "Holds the sound you're playing as an endless pad. Turn Freeze on to capture it and play over it; Layer adds "
      "what you play next on top. Fade In and Fade Out make the frozen sound appear and disappear smoothly. Map "
      "Freeze to a footswitch with MIDI learn for live use." },
    { "delay",
      "A clean digital delay: repeats of what you play. Use short times (80-150 ms) for slapback, around 300-500 ms "
      "for leads, or Sync to lock the repeats to the song's tempo. Ping-Pong bounces the repeats between the "
      "speakers in Stereo mode. Usually goes after drive and the amp, before reverb." },
    { "doppelganger",
      "A delay whose echoes take turns being flanged and chorused, so each repeat has its own colour as it "
      "fades. Order picks which effect comes first, and the Flange and Chorus controls shape each one. Great for "
      "lush, moving leads and ambient parts; in Stereo mode, Bounce moves the echoes between the speakers." },
    { "tapeecho",
      "A vintage tape echo: warm, darkening repeats with a little wobble and saturation, like the classic "
      "multi-head machines. Heads picks which playback heads sound, for rhythmic patterns. High Feedback makes it "
      "build into self-oscillation. Put it after the amp, before reverb." },
    { "duckdelay",
      "A delay that gets out of the way while you play: the echoes are turned down while you're playing and come "
      "back up when you stop. You get big, long delays on leads without the repeats cluttering fast phrases. Set "
      "Threshold so your playing ducks the echoes, and Duck for how much." },
    { "looper",
      "Records a phrase and plays it back as a loop, so you can play over it. Rec/Dub records, then overdubs on "
      "top; Play/Stop and Clear control the loop. In Count In mode a metronome counts you in and clicks while you "
      "record a set number of bars, then the loop plays on without it. Reverse and Half Speed change the playback. "
      "Map the buttons to MIDI footswitches with MIDI learn. Keeps one loop of up to a minute." },
    { "octave",
      "Adds notes one and two octaves below, and one above, what you play, for bass-like riffs and big, organ-like "
      "sounds. It tracks single notes; play cleanly and put it before any drive for the best tracking. Raise "
      "Sub 1 for a bass line under your riff." },
    { "polyoctave",
      "An octave pedal that works on chords too: adds copies one or two octaves below and above everything you "
      "play. Use the subs for huge, organ-like chords or a bass under your riffs, and the octaves up for 12-string "
      "sparkle. Put it before drive and time-based effects." },
    { "pitch",
      "Shifts your sound up or down by up to two octaves, with two independent voices. Use small Detune amounts for "
      "a thick, chorus-like doubling, a few semitones for harmonies, or a full shift to play in a different tuning. "
      "Put it early in the chain, before drive." },
    { "whammy",
      "The classic pitch-bending pedal. Position bends the pitch from no shift to the chosen Interval, for "
      "dive bombs, octave squeals and smooth bends. Map Position to an expression pedal with MIDI learn. Harmony "
      "mode keeps the dry sound so you get a fixed interval harmony instead." },
    { "harmonizer",
      "Adds harmony voices that follow the key and scale you choose, so a third above stays in key as you play "
      "up the neck. Set Key and Scale to the song, then pick intervals for the two voices. Play single notes "
      "cleanly; put it before drive for the clearest harmonies." },
    { "synth",
      "Turns your guitar into a monophonic synthesizer: it tracks the pitch you play and drives an oscillator "
      "through a resonant filter. Wave picks the tone, Env makes the filter open on each note, and Glide slides "
      "between notes. Play single notes cleanly, near the neck, for the best tracking." },
    { "filter",
      "A resonant filter swept by an LFO, for rhythmic, synth-like movement: auto-wah sweeps, pulsing low-pass "
      "chops, or a fixed filter to shape your tone. Sync locks the movement to the song's tempo, and Shape picks "
      "how it moves, from a smooth sine to stepped random-like patterns." },
    { "wah",
      "A wah pedal: a sweeping, vocal-like filter you control with Position. Map Position to an expression pedal "
      "with MIDI learn to rock it like a real wah, or leave it fixed for a cocked-wah tone. Classic is the familiar "
      "pedal, Vox is smoother, Wide sweeps further and Bass suits low notes. Put it before drive." },
    { "autowah",
      "A wah that sweeps by itself as you play: the harder you pick, the further it opens, for funky, quacking "
      "rhythms. Sensitivity sets how much your picking moves it, Decay how fast it falls back. Down reverses the "
      "sweep for a different, vocal feel. Put it before drive." },
    { "gatedfuzz",
      "A wild, unstable fuzz in the style of the Fuzz Factory. Comp starves it into a sputtery, velcro-like rasp, "
      "Gate chops it off between notes, and turning Stab down makes it squeal and oscillate along with your notes. "
      "Put it first in the chain, before any other drive or an amp model." },
    { "envdrive",
      "A drive that follows your picking: clean when you play softly and dirty when you dig in (or, with a negative "
      "Range, the other way round), while soft notes stay soft and loud ones loud. Great for playing dynamics into "
      "a clean amp model. Put it before the amp." },
    { "killswitch",
      "A kill switch and stutter: Kill mutes while held, Stutter chops the sound on and off in time. Map both to "
      "footswitches or MIDI buttons for hand-played stutters, or use Latch so a press switches them on and off. "
      "Put it at the end of the chain so it cuts everything." },
    { "barberpole",
      "A phaser whose sweep seems to rise (or fall) forever, like the stripes on a barber's pole, for an endless, "
      "hypnotic swirl that never turns round. Slow rates sound like constant tension building. Put it after drive, "
      "like other modulation." },
    { "modsweeper",
      "Several modulation pedals in one that it moves between over time: pick two or three of chorus, flanger, "
      "phaser and vibrato, and it sweeps from one to the next (back and forth, or round in a cycle) every Sweep "
      "Rate step, or every bar or beat with Sync. Glide sets how smoothly it morphs. Put it after drive, like other "
      "modulation." },
    { "warble",
      "The sound of worn tape or a warped record: a slow, uneven pitch wobble with a faster flutter, a darker tone "
      "and a bit of saturation. Use it subtly for lo-fi, nostalgic textures, or deep for a seasick wobble. Put it "
      "after drive, or after the amp for a whole-mix tape feel." },
    { "slicer",
      "A rhythmic volume sequencer: up to eight steps, each with its own level, chop your playing into a pattern. "
      "With Sync on, the pattern locks to your DAW's tempo and starts on the bar. Use it for trance-gate chops or "
      "pulsing pads; put it after the amp and before delay and reverb." },
    { "bloomreverb",
      "A reverb that swells up after each note instead of splashing on the pick attack, so your playing stays clear "
      "and the reverb blooms in behind it. Long Bloom and Decay give big, ambient washes. Put it at the end of the "
      "chain, after delay." },
    { "gatedreverb",
      "The classic 80s gated reverb: a big, dense reverb that is cut off abruptly shortly after you stop playing, "
      "so it sounds huge without washing over the next note. Great for punchy chords and stabs. Put it at the end "
      "of the chain." },
    { "reversedelay",
      "A delay whose repeats play backwards, swelling in like a tape played in reverse, for psychedelic, dreamlike "

      "Twelve strings tuned to a key, which ring along when you play their notes, like the drone strings of a "

    { "jawari",
      "The buzzing bridge of a sitar: each note's top is folded back as the string grazes the bridge, for the "

    { "graincloud",
      "Turns your playing into a cloud of tiny grains, scattered in time, some shifted in pitch, some backwards: "

      "before reverb." },
    { "swarm",
      "A dozen short delays, each drifting in pitch and fluttering in level. A little gives a lush 12-string or "

    { "tapestop",
      "Hold its Stop button and the sound slows to a halt like a turntable losing power; let go and it spins back "

    { "patterndelay",
      "Eight echoes on a rhythmic grid, each with its own level, so the echoes play a rhythm; every other echo can "
      "be pitch-shifted for cascading arpeggios. Sync it to your DAW for rhythmic delay parts." },
    { "chaosmod",
      "Modulation from chaos: a Lorenz attractor sweeps a filter, the volume and the pitch in smooth motion that "
      "never repeats, somewhere between an LFO and random. Put it after drive." },
    { "acoustic",
      "Makes an electric guitar sound acoustic: it undoes the pickup's colour, adds the resonances of an acoustic "
      "body and the strings' sparkle. Use it on a clean signal, with no amp after it (or a clean one)." },
    { "strum",
      "Turns each note you pick into a strummed chord: the chord's notes come in one after another, like a hand "

      "before drive." },
    { "hardtune",
      "Pitch correction for guitar: pulls your notes to the nearest note of a key and scale. Set Speed to 0 for "

      "the chain." },
    { "drumtrigger",
      "Plays drums when you hit muted strings: low thumps play a kick, brighter hits a snare, the brightest a "

    { "trumpet",
      "A trumpet played from your notes: brighter as you dig in, scooping up into notes, with a vibrato and mutes. "

    { "violin",
      "A bowed violin, viola or cello played from your notes, with bow noise and vibrato, or a small string "
      "section with Ensemble. Play single notes, slowly and expressively." },

      "Turns your playing into MIDI notes, to play a synth or sampler plugin from your guitar. In Reaper, put the "
      "synth after Xythos in the same FX chain (it receives the notes), or send the track's MIDI to another track. "

      "Plays a fart at the pitch of every note you pick: thirteen kinds, from a tiny squeak to a motorboat, or a "
      "random one each time. Because why not. Play single notes; an octave down sounds best." },
