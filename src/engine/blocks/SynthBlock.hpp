// rises with the playing (Env), with the guitar's own dynamics on the amplitude. The notes come from
// dsp/NoteTracker.hpp: a new note is found about 12 ms after the pick (low notes later); play single notes (chords
// confuse it, as with any guitar synth). The Pick Filter keeps the pick attack's unsteady pitch from sounding; Track
// picks the block's input or the rig's. Waves: square, saw, pulse, and sub (saw plus a square an octave down).
// Config: "lookahead" (ms, 0 by default; blocks/TrackedInput.hpp), which adds that much latency.
